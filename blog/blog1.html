            <p>
                What is our life, really? I ask myself this question so many times —
                <em>What exactly is my life meant for?</em>
                I stand at so many turning points hoping for an answer… but the answer never stands still long enough.
            </p>

            <p>
                Till now, I’ve touched so many paths —
                <strong>bodybuilding, art, craft, sketching, computers, grooming, reading, writing</strong> —
                and I’m still exploring. I’m in the final year of my B.Tech. In the next few months, this chapter of my
                life will end.
            </p>

            <p>
                Earlier, I used to feel lost: I had no strong skills, no real experience, no emotional intelligence,
                nothing to anchor me. But slowly, step by step, improvement arrived. A little discipline.
                A little clarity. A little growth.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-white">Who Am I? Where Am I Going?</h2>

            <p>
                This question hits me every time I try to motivate myself. Am I the main character in my own story,
                or just a background character in someone else’s world?
            </p>

            <p>
                I look at my brother, who is my age and already contributing to his father’s business. That’s not a
                small thing.
                I look at my older brother who became a CA and is building stability for himself — and even for the next
                generation.
            </p>

            <p>
                From what I see, life is a delicate mixture of luck and hard work — both shaping us in ways we often
                don’t understand. And whenever I think about this balance, Krishna’s words return to me like a quiet
                reminder:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-white/30 pl-4 italic text-gray-200">
                “Do your karma. Do not be attached to the result.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                But what does that truly mean for me? Does it imply that my life is already shaped by the structure of
                my karma,
                written long before I was born? Or does it give me the freedom to rise above it?
            </p>

            <p>
                Then another thought follows — Krishna’s declaration of his universal nature:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-white/30 pl-4 italic text-gray-200">
                “I am the universe. I am destruction. I am the beginning and the end.
                I am the stars, the earth, and the sky.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                If Krishna embodies everything, then what am I in this vast design? What role do I play?
            </p>

            <p>
                And just as this question forms, a deeper truth echoes:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-white/30 pl-4 italic text-gray-200">
                “The soul is never born, and it never dies. The same energy that lives in a newborn child
                exists in an old dying man.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                If the soul remains forever unchanged and eternal, then what about the actions I take in this temporary
                life?
                Even if I achieve something remarkable, am I driven by pure intention — or by a hidden selfishness I
                haven’t yet understood?
            </p>

            <p>
                Does Arjun become the main character because of the purity of his soul, or simply because the story
                needed him to be?
                Does someone born in a small village automatically become a background character?
            </p>

            <p>
                History remembers the ones who choose to rise — the ones who decide to become more than their
                circumstances.
                And maybe that is where the real difference lies.
            </p>


            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 text-white">So… What Is Life?</h2>

            <p>
                Maybe life isn’t about finding an answer. Maybe it’s about living the questions with honesty,
                courage, discipline, and awareness — until one day, the answer reveals itself.
            </p>
